# Data analysis 

This directory contains all R code for data analysis, it was developed within JetBrains DataSpell IDE and requires R to be installed.

## Implementation notes

- Due to the size of the results from `pre_testing\model_testing\results`, R has been used to analyze the results
- It is assumed that the .csv file is included within this directory for analysis is huge, so will not be included in the repository
- Make sure there is enough memory available to run the analysis
