# Purpose: File to demonstrate how to use the YOLO model to detect objects in an image (and print the results to the console).
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model

# Perform object detection on an image
detection = model("../testing_images/many_cats.jpg")

# Get possible objects to detect

# Get a list of names of detected objects

    detected_objects.append(possible_objects[cls.item()])

# Print the detected objects
print(detected_objects)

# Save the image with the bounding boxes drawn on
