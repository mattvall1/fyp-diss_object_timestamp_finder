# Load the required libraries
library(data.table)

# Set DB path

# First, get some statistics about the table

# Get BLEU scores for each model

# Get METEOR scores for each model

# Get ROUGE-1 scores for each model

# Get count of failed URLs

# Get count of other errors
other_errors <- dbGetQuery(db_conn, "SELECT COUNT(timestamp) AS other_errors FROM other_errors")

# Close the database connection as we now have all the data we need

# Create a summary table
